# **BMI calculator**

### Description

This is a simple BMI calculator created extracurricularly during the programming course. The "input" event was used in the JavaScript code. The photo used in the background comes from my private photo collection :) The calculator page is still being improved.

BMI calculator contains:
- HTML
